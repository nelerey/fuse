# FUSE

## Description and credits

This is a source code repository for the **Framework for Understanding Structural Errors** or **FUSE**. The initial implementation is described in [Clark et al. (WRR, 2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006735). This implementation involves four main additional features:

1. a snow module described in [Henn et al. (WRR, 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR016736),
2. a calibration mode using [Duan et al. (WRR, 1992)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/91WR02985) shuffled complex evolution alogrithm (SCE),
3. a distributed mode enabling to run FUSE on a grid, and
4. all the input, output and parameter files are now NetCDF files.

## FUSE modes and case studies

FUSE can be run in four complementary modes:

1. `run_def` runs FUSE with default parameter values,
2. `run_pre` runs FUSE with with a pre-defined set of parameter values,
3. `calib_sce` runs FUSE in an SCE-calibration mode,
4. `run_best` runs FUSE using the best (lowest RMSE) parameter set found by SCE.

To get you started with FUSE, we provide files for two case studies involing modeling at different spatial scales:

* catchment scale: forcing and streamflow data for the [USGS 09066300 MIDDLE CREEK NEAR MINTURN, CO.](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=09066300&agency_cd=USGS&) catchment - available [here [0.5MB]](
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/f6omcgz8hsirlr0/fuse_catch.zip?dl=0) for download,  
* grid scale: forcing from a climate model on a 1/8th degree grid for a 58 x 28 grid cells domain - available [here [42MB]](
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/g5193e0n01ao33d/fuse_grid.zip?dl=0) for download.

Follow the following steps to run FUSE for the catchment case study.

## A. Fork this repository and compile FUSE
1. Fork this repository to a directory `$(MASTER)` on your machine (see the [SUMMA manual](http://summa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/SUMMA_and_git/) for a step-by-step procedure)
1. Change directory to `$(MASTER)/build/` and edit the `Makefile`, by:
   1. defining the name of the master directory (line 10),
   2. defining the fortran compiler (line 201),
   3. defining the path to the NetCDF libraries (lines 204-224, note that the NetCDF libraries must be compiled using the same compiler that you are using to compile FUSE).
 1. Compile the SCE code (see Section H below).
 1. Compile the FUSE code (type `make`).
 1. Change to `$(MASTER)/bin/` and try running FUSE by typing `./fuse.exe`. If the output is `1st command-line argument is missing (fileManager)`, you have probably compiled FUSE correctly.Â 
 
## B. Populate the bin directory
To run FUSE, you must use a `FILEMANAGER`, which defines the paths to the FUSE `settings`, `input`, `output` directories, as well as other settings essential to run FUSE (described  in Sections C and D). 
1. Move the file `fm_catch.txt` provided for the catchment case study to `$(MASTER)/bin/`. This is the `FILEMANAGER` for the catchment case study.
1. Update the lines 4 to 6 of `fm_catch.txt` using the path of the `fuse_catch` directory on your machine.
   
## C. Populate the setup directory
The `setup` directory must contain the following files (provided for the catchment case study):

   1. The file `M_DECISIONS` (called `fuse_zDecisions_902.txt` in the case studies) describes the different options available in the FUSE modeling framework. These modeling decisions are described in detail by [Clark et al. (WRR, 2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006735), except decision 9 described in [Henn et al. (WRR, 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR016736).
   2. The file `CONSTRAINTS` (called `fuse_zConstraints_snow.txt` in the case studies) defines in particular the default parameter values and lower and upper parameter bounds. The list of parameters corresponds to those described in [Clark et al. (WRR, 2008)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2007WR006735) and [Henn et al. (WRR, 2015)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2014WR016736). 
   3. The file `MOD_NUMERIX` (called `fuse_zNumerix.txt` in the case studies) defines decisions regarding the numerical solution technique. Examples of the impact of these decisions are described by [Clark and Kavetski (WRR 2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009WR008894) and [Kavetski and Clark (WRR 2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2009WR008896).
   4. The file `FORCINGINFO` (called `input_info.txt` in the case studies) provides metadata for the NetCDF input file. It defines the name and units of the variables in the input file.

## D. Populate the input directory
The `input` directory must contain the following files (provided for the catchment case study):

   1. The file `forcefile` (called `us_09066300_input.nc` in the catchment case study) contains the input data in a 2D (resp. 3D) arrays for modeling at the catchment (resp. grid) scale. The name of this file is made by appending the `suffix_forcing` defined in the `FILEMANAGER` (see B) to the basin ID (see E `$2`).
   2. The file `BFILE` (called `us_09066300_elev_bands.nc` in the catchment case study) describe the elevation bands required when the snow module is on. The dimensions of this file must match that of `forcefile`. The name of this file is made by appending the `suffix_elev_bands` defined in the `FILEMANAGER` (see B) to the basin ID (see E `$2`).
   
Note that the dimension of the NetCDF files will determine if FUSE is run at the catchment or grid-scale. FUSE will look for the variables `lat` and `lon` and if they are arrays, it will run on the grid they define. This means that NetCDF input files for a single catchment must also include the variables `lat` and `lon`.
   
## E. Execute FUSE

Run FUSE unsing default parameter values at the catchment scale:
```
./fuse.exe fm_catch.txt us_09066300 run_def
```

then calibrate it:

```
./fuse.exe fm_catch.txt us_09066300 calib_sce
```

then run it with the best SCE parameter set:

```
./fuse.exe fm_catch.txt us_09066300 run_best
```

where
`$1` is the file manager,
`$2` is the basin ID,
`$3` is the FUSE mode.

## F. Content of the output directory
Running FUSE in its different modes will create the following files in the `output` directory (provided for the catchment case study for comparison purposes):
* the files whose name contains `runs` contain the simulations, 
* the files whose name contains `para` contain the parameter values,
* the last element of the file name indicates which FUSE mode was used.

## G. Run FUSE for the grid case study

Download the data for the grid scale case study (see `FUSE modes and case studies` section) and follow the same steps as for the catchment scale case study. 

Run FUSE unsing default parameter values over the grid:

```
./fuse.exe fm_grid.txt cesm1-cam5 run_def
```

Note that because the gridded data does not contain streamflow, FUSE cannot be calibrated using SCE. Instead, FUSE can be run using pre-defined parameter sets using the `run_pre` mode (description to be added).   
   
## H. Compile SCE
The code of the shuffled complex evolution method (`$(MASTER)/build/FUSE_SRC/FUSE_SCE/sce.f`) was written in F77, so it must be compiled separately. If you use `ifort`, try the following flags:
  ```
  ifort -O2 -c -fixed sce_16plus.f
  ```

If necessary, rename the compiled file, so that it can be found by the `Makefile`, which by default will be looking for a file named `sce_16plus.o`.
