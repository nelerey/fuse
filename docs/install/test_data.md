## Data for two spatial configurations

To enable you to try FUSE, we provide data for three test cases. Each test case contains all the files needed to run FUSE, in particular the atmospheric forcing, model decision files and parameter files. The two first test cases will enable you to test FUSE in its two spatial configurations - FUSE can be run for an individual catchment or on a grid - while the third one will enable you to run FUSE at the continental scale over the US combined with the routing system mizuRoute.

## Catchment test case

Observed atmospheric forcing and streamflow estimates for the catchment [Middle Creek near Minturn](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/inventory/?site_no=09066300&agency_cd=USGS&) in Colorado, USA  - data available [here [0.5MB]](

## Grid test case

Atmospheric forcing simulated by a climate model on a 1/8th degree grid for a 58 x 28 grid cells domain - data available [here [42MB]](

## CONUS test case

Forcing from the Maurer data set on a 1/8th degree grid covering the contiguous United States (CONUS) and mizuRoute input files - data available [here [85MB]](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/ikz2u4762y1zek1/fuse_conus.zip?dl=0) for download.
